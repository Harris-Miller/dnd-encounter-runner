# dnd-encounter-runner

A remake of https://improvedinitiative.app/ (https://github.com/cynicaloptimist/improved-initiative) for the express purpose of learning how to deploy a frontend, backend, managed postgres/redis, etc, on _n_-number of Cloud providers

## TODO

Make a more simple server2 that just uses ExpressJS. Elysia is good but is limiting and has poor docs and concepts.
Building websockets that can correctly reconnect across horizontally scaled instances should be first explored with ExpressJS
since I know more-less how to do that via SocketIO + redis plugin
